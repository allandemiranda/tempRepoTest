 * 7. FileProcessor
 */

/**
 * A given module of the application contains a feature that is responsible for processing a csv file. Basically, this
 * processing reads some columns of each line of the file and then write the data in other files. Now the business team
 * asked us to perform some filtering in the data that is read from the csv file before outputting it to the final
 * files. Basically, the initial requirement states that, for each row, if the value of the column 3 is found in another
 * file (c:\invalid_data.csv), then the line should be skipped. Your task is to write a code that implements this
 * requirement. Your solution should follow good coding practices (clean code, SOLID, etc.). Also keep in mind that in
 * the future more requirements could be added to this feature. For example: the business team could ask us to consider
 * multiple columns in the filter, or even add a completely different filter logic that uses a computation based on
 * values from the current line. So, your code should be extensible, should support adding/removing filters, should
 * support evaluation of multiple filter for the same line, etc. Unit tests are mandatory.
